Remove your watermark like the dishonest swine you are!

Heres the tutorial on how to cheese the windows activation logo on windows 10.

Step 1 Run the Batch file. NOT THE VBS!!!

Step 2 restart pc.

Step 3 (Optional) Move Vbs but not the Bat file unless you want my github to popup everytime you boot to the SAME startup folder so it automatically runs and removes watermark as this fix is only temporary. (Unless run on startup)
