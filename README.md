# Windows-Activation-Dodger
Remove your watermark like the dishonest swine you are!

How to run 

Step 1 Run ActivationDodger.bat (OR if you downloaded the executable installer run that first)

Step 2 Restart pc.

Step 3 (Optional) Move Wrapper.vbs to the Windows startup folder (The default directory will be displayed when the bat file is run). Make sure you dont move ActivationDodger or Appdata to the startup because the Wrapper will automatically trace the directory.
